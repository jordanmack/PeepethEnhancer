# Peepeth Enhancer

Peepeth Enhancer is a collection of scripts that add several new features to Peepeth.

* Hide the user avatar badges.

## Installation 

To use this user script install you will need a browser plugin to run user scripts. Here are a few options:
* [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) (Supports multiple browsers.)
* [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Supports Firefox only.)
* [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) (Supports multiple browsers.)

Once you have the plugin installed, you will need to configure Tampermonkey.
* Open the Tampermonkey dashboard.
* Create a new userscript.
* Copy and paste the contents of [user.js](user.js) into the Tampermonkey editor.
* Go to File > Save from the menu to save the script.
